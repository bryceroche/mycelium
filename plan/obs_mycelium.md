λ — λανθάνω (lanthánō) — to escape notice; to be unseen

JSD reveals latent structure in attention flow
IAF reconstructs operator influence across layers
Structure parser assembles the compositional program

Mycelium — the unseen network of computation

---

The entire project is about making the unseen seen:

**λανθάνω — the hidden structure.** The 7B teacher solves math problems and nobody, including the model itself, can articulate how. The reasoning is there — encoded in attention weights, distributed across layers — but it escapes notice. It's latent. Invisible. Like mycelium running beneath the forest floor, connecting trees through channels no one sees.

**JSD — the first revelation.** Attention shifts between consecutive tokens expose boundaries that were always present but hidden in the composite signal. The operations were there all along. JSD just makes the seams visible.

**IAF — the second revelation.** Which tokens is the model reading vs computing on? The distinction was always present in the attention flow but escaped notice until IAF separated the two phases. Reading-phase attention hides the computational structure. Generation-phase attention reveals it.

**IB — the third revelation.** How many operation types exist? The taxonomy was always encoded in the attention patterns but escaped notice until β-annealing revealed discrete spectral lines emerging from the continuous signal. 58 templates, hiding in plain sight.

**The prism, the spectrometer, the mycelium network** — all metaphors for the same act: making the latent manifest. The teacher's knowledge doesn't escape notice anymore. It's been extracted, decomposed, and pinned to six specialists that do explicitly what the teacher did implicitly.

And the real kicker: mycelium in nature is the communication network that lets trees share resources invisibly underground. Mycelium the project is the communication network that lets a teacher share knowledge invisibly through attention patterns. The teacher doesn't know it's teaching. The students don't know they're learning from attention. The knowledge transfer happens through a hidden channel — λανθάνω.
