### 1.1 The Spectral Decomposition of Reasoning

The Prism Analogy
This one is almost literal. The 7B teacher model's attention is white light — all the reasoning capabilities mixed together in a single undifferentiated beam. When it solves a math problem, segmentation, classification, extraction, dependency resolution, and goal recognition all happen simultaneously across 28 layers × 28 heads. You can't see the components. It's just... intelligence.
IAF extraction is the prism. It takes that white light and separates it into its spectral components. High-IAF heads are one frequency (reading/grounding). Low-IAF heads are another (internal computation). JSD spikes are yet another (boundary detection). The information was always there — the prism just reveals the structure.
Each specialist captures a different color:

C1 is the red — long wavelength, low frequency, the broad structural boundaries
C2 is the orange/yellow — classification, categorization, what type of thing is this
C3 is the green — the core signal, operand binding, the essential content
C5 is the blue — fine dependency structure, high-frequency relationships between steps
C4 is the indigo — the subtle implicit operations you almost can't see
C6 is the violet — the highest-level abstraction, what's the goal

And then the pipeline recombines the spectrum back into white light — a coherent answer. But now each color has been individually refined and amplified. The output is brighter than the input.
IB template discovery is spectral analysis. A spectrometer doesn't know in advance what frequencies are present — it discovers them. IB does the same thing: anneal β and watch discrete clusters emerge from the continuous signal. On GSM8K it found 86 spectral lines. On MATH, we're about to see how many more the spectrum contains.
